Simplifying Boolean Expressions Using the Quine-McCluskey Method

Abstract

This project aims to develop a Python implementation of the Quine-McCluskey (QM) method for simplifying Boolean expressions. The project focuses on the simplicity and clarity of the algorithm while providing a robust solution for generating prime implicants and minimising Boolean expressions using Petrick's Method. The implementation can be further optimised for performance. The algorithm comprises two main parts: generating prime implicants by recursively performing a 1-bit comparison, and selecting the minimum set of prime implicants that cover all minterms using Petrick's Method.

Introduction

Boolean expressions are fundamental in digital logic design and simplifying them is essential for creating efficient logic circuits. The Quine-McCluskey method is a systematic approach for minimising Boolean functions, which is especially useful for functions with many variables. This project implements the QM method in Python, including an explanation of the algorithm and a complete code implementation.

1. Implementation


Algorithm for the Quine-McCluskey Method

Step-by-Step Explanation
(Note: Italic font has been used to show the code snippets)

1. Collect All Minterms
   Convert each minterm to its binary representation.
   Store these binary representations in a list (`Minterm_List`).

   Example:
   minterms = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
   binary_minterms = ['0010', '0100', '0110', '0111', '1000']

2. Initialise Lists
   Create `List_1` by copying the minterm list and removing duplicates.

   Example:
   List_1 = ['0010', '0100', '0110', '0111', '1000']

3. Process Don't Care Terms (if any)
   Convert donâ€™t care terms to binary and add to `List_1`.

   Example:
   dont_care_terms = [3, 5]
   List_1 += ['0011', '0101']

4. 1-Bit Comparison and Grouping
   Compare each binary string in `List_1` with every other string.
   If they differ by exactly one bit, create a new string with a wildcard `_` at the    differing bit position and add to `List_2`.
   If no such comparison is possible, add the string to `List_3`.

   Example:
   List_2 = ['0_10', '01_0']
   List_3 = ['1000', '0110']

5. Iterate Until Completion
   Repeat the above steps until `List_1` and `List_2` are empty.
   The final `List_3` will contain all prime implicants.

   Example:
   List_3 = ['1000', '0_10', '011_', '01_0']

6. Remove Duplicates from List_3
   Convert `List_3` to a set to remove duplicates and convert it back to a list.

   Example:
   List_3 = list(set(List_3))

7. Create Prime Implicant Table
   For each prime implicant, determine the minterms it covers by replacing wildcards with all possible 0 and 1 combinations.

   Example:
   Table: 
          Implicant     Implicant_string           Combo           Binrep
0            I0                  0001                      [m8]             1000
1            I1                  0010                  [m2, m6]           0_10
2            I2                  0100                  [m6, m7]           011_
3            I3                 1000                   [m4, m6]          01_0

8. Apply Petrick's Method
   Construct a logical function \( P \) that represents all columns being covered.
   Use De Morgan's Laws to simplify \( P \) into a sum of products.
   Identify the minimum set of prime implicants by finding the terms with the fewest literals.

   Example:
   P = (I0 + I1) * (I1 + I2) * (I2 + I3)
   Simplified P = I1I2 + I0I3

9. Generate Simplified Boolean Expression
   Convert the selected prime implicants back to the original Boolean variables.

   Example:
   Expression = A'B + BC
